This short film celebrates the type of flying I enjoy when flying in the virtual world, whether online or not.\n\nI started using Flight Simulators over 30 years ago as a much younger person. If I could show my 8 year old self how things would look in the future, my mind would be blown \ud83e\udd2f ! Just imagine what flight simulation will feel like in another 30 years.\n\nThis film is a sequel of sorts to another experiement I posted onto Vimeo in 2016, which was also showcasing the best of flight simulation in that era \u2013 how things have progressed. Those who have seen the 2016 version will notice a number of nods to that piece in this version.\n\nArt of Flight | 2016 https://vimeo.com/194935864 \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Simulators\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2020 https://www.flightsimulator.com \nX-Plane 12 https://www.x-plane.com",

Situated on the beach with a cold drink, we spent a sunny afternoon watching many arrivals and departures from the warm golden sands, dipping our toes in the aqua blue Caribbean Sea.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f Aircraft Spotted\n\n- Airbus A330-300 (Air France, KLM)\n- Airbus A320-200 (JetBlue)\n- Airbus A320neo (Spirit)\n- Boeing 737-600 (United)\n- Boeing 757-200 (Delta)\n- Cessna 208 Caravan\n- ATR-42\n- DeHavilland Twin Otter\n- Britten Islander\n- Challenger 650  \n\nSit back on the sandy beach, grab a cold drink and watch all of the arrivals and departures from this little airport in the heart of paradise.\n\nThis video was shot entirely on an iPhone 15 Pro Max using the camera app, and edited and finalized using Davinci Resolve on the iPad.
